Elements
Design Thinking,Hub,Completed,"Human-centered method for problem-solving emphasizing cooperation, empathy, and creativity. It is an iterative, non-linear process."
Empathize Phase,Principle,Completed,"The first step in DT, entailing understanding user needs and perspectives by conducting research, interviews, and observations."
Define Phase,Principle,Completed,"Combines information from the Empathize phase to identify key issues and create problem statements."
Ideate Phase,Principle,Completed,"Generating a variety of creative solutions to the defined problem, encouraging divergent thinking."
Prototype Phase,Principle,Completed,"Ideas are transformed into tangible or digital representations that can be tested and refined quickly and cheaply."
Test Phase,Principle,Completed,"Evaluating prototypes with real users to gather feedback and insights, assessing Desirable, Feasible, Viable criteria."
Human Rule,Principle,Completed,"Emphasizes prioritizing human needs, behaviors, and emotions throughout the design process (Human-Centered Design)."
Ambiguity Rule,Principle,Completed,"Necessitates embracing ambiguity to reframe complex problems and explore multiple perspectives."
Redesign Rule,Principle,Completed,"Emphasizes the iterative nature of the design process, focusing on changing the means of solving the problem."
Tangibility Rule,Principle,Completed,"Emphasizes making ideas tangible and concrete through prototypes or visual representations like sketching."
DFV Framework,Principle,Completed,"Criteria for successful solutions: Desirable (meets user needs), Feasible (technologically/operationally possible), Viable (economically sustainable)."
Design Thinking in Software and AI Projects,Spoke,Completed,"Application of DT to drive a broader array of software and AI projects, often associated with user experience (UX) design."
Overcoming Fear of Failure,Mental Model,Completed,"A recognized ingredient in DT, viewing failure as an opportunity to learn what doesn't work (failing forward)."
Collaboration and Teamwork,Pillar,Completed,"A key benefit and principle of DT, bringing diverse viewpoints and specialties together to address complex issues."
Design Thinking Innovative Solutions for a Better World.pdf,Source,Completed,"Primary text detailing the methodology, rules, phases, and applications of Design Thinking."
Design Thinking in Software and AI Projects _ Proving Ideas.pdf,Source,Completed,"Source discussing the application of Design Thinking in software and AI projects, focusing on workshops and development philosophy."
Designing Human-Centric AI Experiences_ Applied UX Design.pdf,Source,Completed,"Source covering the application of UX Design principles and ethical considerations in developing AI products."
